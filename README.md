To create a virtual environment for your Django project, you can use virtualenv or venv (if you are using Python 3.3 or newer). Here's how you can do it using venv:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your project directory.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment named env (you can replace env with any name you prefer):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, run:

bash
Copy code
env\Scripts\activate
On macOS and Linux, run:

bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
Your virtual environment is now activated. You should see (env) in your command prompt.
